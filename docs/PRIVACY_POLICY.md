# ReplySage Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 2024**

## Overview

ReplySage is designed with privacy as a core principle. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data and what information is processed when you use our AI email assistant browser extension.

## Data Processing Principles

### Local-First Architecture
- **Default Processing**: All email analysis happens locally on your device
- **No Data Collection**: We don't collect, store, or transmit your email content
- **User Control**: You decide what data is processed and where

### Optional Cloud Processing
- **User-Controlled**: Cloud processing only occurs when you explicitly enable it
- **Your API Keys**: When using cloud features, we use your own API keys
- **No Server Storage**: We don't store your data on our servers

## Information We Process

### 1. Email Content (Local Processing)
When you use ReplySage locally:
- **What**: Email subject, body text, sender information, attachments metadata
- **Where**: Processed entirely on your device
- **Purpose**: Generate summaries, extract action items, suggest replies
- **Retention**: Stored locally in your browser's storage (you can clear anytime)

### 2. Email Content (Cloud Processing)
When you enable cloud fallback:
- **What**: Same as local processing, but sent to cloud AI services
- **Where**: Your chosen cloud provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Purpose**: Complex analysis tasks requiring more powerful models
- **Retention**: Controlled by your cloud provider's policies

### 3. Extension Usage Data
- **What**: Basic usage statistics (number of emails analyzed, features used)
- **Where**: Stored locally, optionally sent to us (if you opt-in)
- **Purpose**: Improve the extension and understand usage patterns
- **Retention**: Local data persists until you clear it; analytics data is anonymized

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
- **Browser Storage**: Settings, cached analysis results, user preferences
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data (API keys) is encrypted using WebCrypto
- **Control**: You can clear all data anytime through the extension settings

### Cloud Storage
