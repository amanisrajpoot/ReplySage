- **Privacy**: All data processing happens locally by default

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Extension**: Chrome MV3 Manifest
- **Local AI**: ONNX Runtime Web / Transformers.js
- **Models**: Flan-T5-small, MiniLM embeddings
- **Storage**: Chrome Storage API + IndexedDB
- **Build**: Vite + Web Extension Plugin
